# Tic-Tac-Toe Game ðŸŽ®

Overview

    This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to 
    take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (either 
    vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the 
    game ends in a draw.

Code Highlights
â€¢ HTML
The HTML structure consists of a simple flex layout for the Tic-Tac-Toe board:

 <!-- Board -->
    <div id="board">
        <!-- Game Box -->
        <div class="box box-0" id="0"></div>
        <div class="box box-1" id="1"></div>
        <div class="box box-2" id="2"></div>
        <div class="box box-3" id="3"></div>
        <div class="box box-4" id="4"></div>
        <div class="box box-5" id="5"></div>
        <div class="box box-6" id="6"></div>
        <div class="box box-7" id="7"></div>
        <div class="box box-8" id="8"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

â€¢ CSS
The CSS styles the grid and handles the visual appearance of the game:

    #board {
      width: 450px;
      display: flex;
      flex-wrap: wrap;
      margin-top: 95px;
    }

    .box {
      height: 150px;
      width: 150px;
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      font-size: 120px;
      border-right: 2px solid #8bc6ec;
      border-bottom: 2px solid #8bc6ec;
      font-family: "Kalnia Glaze", serif;
      cursor: pointer;
    }

â€¢ JavaScript
The JavaScript handles the game logic and checks for winning conditions:

    let boxes = Array.from(document.getElementsByClassName("box"));

    let currentPlayer = O_letter;

    const startGame = () => {
      boxes.forEach((box) => box.addEventListener("click", boxClicked));
    };

    function boxClicked(e) {
     const id = e.target.id;

    if (spaces[id] === null) {
      spaces[id] = currentPlayer;
      e.target.innerText = currentPlayer;

    if (checkWin()) {
      alert(`Player ${currentPlayer} wins!`);
      resetGame();
    } else if (checkDraw()) {
      alert("It's a draw!");
      resetGame();
    } else {
      currentPlayer = currentPlayer === O_letter ? X_letter : O_letter;
       }
      }
    }
